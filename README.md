Technical Exercise for Java Developer Role.
Pricer.java contains main function
HenrysGroceries has 4 products each in different units and prices and
two discount offers providing reduced prices for a particular time period for particular products.
A basket of goods consisting of the number of items bought on a particular day.
Four different baskets are given and the program must value each basket correctly, considering how the 
particular discounts apply.  The program calculates the baskets correctly with net prices for the baskets
matching the expected price.  

It was hoped that I would have junit to test each basket and that it would be posssible to enter new baskets of goods at 
the command-line.  This proved to be the bridge too far as I ran out of time.  I have provided the source code here in 
a number of java files
